# Ride-Logging-and-Analysis

## Overview
A ride logging feature using the FullCalendar.io library and Plotly.js for visualizations. This feature allows users to log a bicycle ride using a calendar interface, visualize their activity based on specific metrics (speed, distance, time, count), and set goals to compare against their current activity.
